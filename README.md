key-lime-pie
============

key-lime-pie is a custom video playback program designed to playback video, over two raspberry pi's, to allow for keying of video using a vision mixer. It builds on omxplayer, for video playback, and uses opengl es2 for rendering of text over the video backgrounds.

Very early and very sloppy :)
